What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

The assignment helped me learn the differences between coding in 
C and Java, such as declaring variables and functions at the top and
using libraries such as stdio.h. 
This was also my first experience implementing a DFA.
I enjoyed gaining familiarity with bash and the CLI, from pushing and 
pulling using multiple git respositories, to breaking down the 
C build process into its 4 steps, to testing my source code using
a variety of text files and bash commands.
This assignment taught me a lot about what goes into preprocessing a 
program.
